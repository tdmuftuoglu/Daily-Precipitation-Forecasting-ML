[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/KULLANICI_ADINIZ/Daily-Precipitation-Forecasting-ML/blob/main/DailyPrecipForecastML.ipynb)

A comprehensive machine learning pipeline to forecast daily precipitation using the NASA POWER dataset. This project was developed by **Dr. Tevfik Denizhan MÃ¼ftÃ¼oÄŸlu**.

## About the Project

This repository contains the complete code and data for a study on daily precipitation forecasting. The project implements a systematic workflow that includes:
1.  **Independent Statistical Analyses**: Gumbel Return Period analysis and Theil-Sen trend analysis on extreme weather events.
2.  **Automated Feature Selection**: An XGBoost-based method to identify the most predictive features from meteorological data.
3.  **Comprehensive Model Competition**: A head-to-head comparison of 11 different time-series and machine learning models to identify the best performer.
4.  **In-depth Visualization**: Generation of performance charts, time-series comparisons, and architectural diagrams.

The primary tool used is a Google Colab notebook (`.ipynb`), which ensures a fully reproducible and environment-independent analysis.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**:
  - Gumbel Distribution for return period analysis of extreme precipitation.
  - Mann-Kendall / Theil-Sen analysis for trend detection in extreme events.
- **Machine Learning Models Implemented**:
  - **Tree-based**: XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest
  - **Statistical**: SARIMAX, Prophet
  - **Neural Networks**: ANN (Artificial Neural Network), LSTM, GRU
  - **Ensemble Methods**: Stacking Ensemble, Hybrid (Prophet + XGBoost)
- **Outputs**: The script automatically generates and saves performance tables, comparison plots, and model architecture diagrams.

## How to Run

This project is designed to be run in Google Colab, which requires no local setup.

**Prerequisites:**
- A Google Account.
- The dataset file: `NASAPOWERDATASET.csv`.

**Steps:**

1.  **Open the Notebook**: Click the "Open in Colab" badge at the top of this README.
2.  **Upload Data**: When the code prompts for a file upload in the second step (`STEP 2`), select the `NASAPOWERDATASET.csv` file from your local machine.
3.  **Run the Code**: In Colab, go to the "Runtime" menu and select "Run all".

The notebook will handle all library installations, data processing, model training, and visualization, downloading the results directly to your browser.

## Dataset

The dataset used is `NASAPOWERDATASET.csv`, which is sourced from the [NASA POWER Project](https://power.larc.nasa.gov/). It contains daily time-series data for various meteorological parameters.

## How to Cite
