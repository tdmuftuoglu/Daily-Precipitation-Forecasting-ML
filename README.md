This repository provides a reproducible Google Colab pipeline for a comprehensive comparative analysis of 11 machine learning models for daily precipitation forecasting. The workflow uses satellite-based meteorological data and includes preliminary statistical analyses such as Gumbel return period and Theil-Sen trend detection.

The framework is designed for researchers and practitioners to benchmark various forecasting models and conduct climatological trend analyses on any location-specific, satellite-derived time-series data.
